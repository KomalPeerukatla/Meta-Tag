    Rishabh Pant, born on October 4, 1997, in Roorkee, Uttarakhand, is an Indian cricketer known for his explosive
    batting and fearless wicketkeeping. Rising through the ranks with a stellar performance in the 2016 U-19 World Cup,
    he soon earned a spot in India’s national team. Despite early inconsistencies, his natural talent and aggressive
    style made him a fan favorite, especially after his match-winning performances in Australia’s 2020–21 Test series.
    In 2022, Pant faced a major setback when he survived a near-fatal car accident, which kept him out of cricket for
    more than a year. By 2025, after intense rehabilitation, he made a remarkable return to professional cricket,
    showing grit, maturity, and leadership as he resumed duties with the Delhi Capitals in the IPL and rejoined the
    Indian squad. His journey is now seen as a powerful story of resilience, passion, and determination.
